- Break your work into small, incremental pieces that and commit that. Prefer colocating tests with their implementation when possible.
- Wherever feasible, prefer small, focused commits for easier reviews.
- Include any important context in your commit bodies, but avoid excessive detail. Brevity is valuable, so long as important details are not lost.
- Avoid writing comments that simply re-state what the code that follows is doing. Comments that explain the reasoning behind a decision are fine, however.
- Ensure that the tests, linters, formatters, and type checks all pass prior to completing your task (ideally before committing as well).
- Maintain a similar style and tone as the rest of the code. Consistency is important.
- When working within monorepos, cd to the directory of the project, then run the command within the scope of that project, then cd back to the root. This way, you'll have correct permissions w.r.t. commands that have been pre-authorized.
- If a command fails because you're in the wrong subdirectory of a monorepo, cd to the correct one, then try again.
- Avoid using commands like `git -C /some/long/absolute/path`, instead cd to the directory first.

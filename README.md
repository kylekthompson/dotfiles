These are my dotfiles! They are an always-changing WIP, so feel free to use them, but be careful!

## Install
3 Easy steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/kylekthompson/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles

script/bootstrap
```

And that's it! This will symlink any .symlink file into your home directory

## Thanks
